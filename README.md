**System Design some are not needed anyways**
 Application Layer (Backend)
This layer handles the core business logic, processing, and integrations. Key components include:

API Gateway: Serves as the single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices. It also handles authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformation.

Microservices Architecture: The backend is broken down into independently deployable services, each responsible for specific functionalities. Some key microservices include:

User Service: Manages user authentication, roles, profiles, and access control.
Course Service: Handles course creation, content management, and course progress tracking.
Payment Service: Manages subscriptions, payment processing, and billing.
Analytics Service: Gathers data for insights on user engagement, course metrics, and platform performance.
Notification Service: Sends email and in-app notifications for updates, announcements, and deadlines.
Support Service: Manages support tickets, FAQs, and user queries.
Authentication & Authorization: Secure authentication using OAuth 2.0 or JWT for managing user sessions and permissions. A central Identity Provider (IdP) can also be integrated for SSO capabilities.

Messaging Queue: Implements asynchronous communication between services, such as RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or AWS SQS, to handle notifications, task queues, and data processing without blocking operations.

Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances of services to ensure high availability and reliability.

Caching Layer: Utilizes Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.

External Integrations:

Payment Gateway Integration: For handling transactions securely with services like Stripe, PayPal, or Razorpay.
