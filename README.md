A platform where students can learn tech-related courses, offering both frontend and backend development, as well as other technologies, is typically called an "e-learning platform" or a "tech education platform." If it provides a comprehensive curriculum covering fullstack development (both frontend and backend), it may also be referred to as a "fullstack development platform." Examples include platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Codecademy, and freeCodeCamp.

To make the learning experience even richer, the platform can offer a wide range of tech-related courses, including:
